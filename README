NOTICE
    This module is considered pre-ALPHA and under-documented. Its use is
    strongly discouraged except under experimental conditions. Particularly
    susceptible to change will be the table structure of the database, which
    currently does not yet even have any auto-create method.

Requisite Plug-in Functions
    See CAD::Drawing::IO for a description of the plug-in architecture.

  check_type

    Returns true if $type is "circ" or $filename is a directory containing a
    ".circ" file.

      $fact = check_type($filename, $type);

Back-End Input and output methods
    The functions load() and save() are responsible for determining the
    filetype (with forced types available via $opt->{type}.) These then call
    the appropriate load<thing> or save<thing> functions.

  load

    Loads a CAD::Drawing object from an SQL database. $spec should be of the
    form required by the database driver.

    $opts->{auth} = ["username", "password"] may be required to create a
    connection.

      $drw->load($spec, $opts);

  save

      $drw->save($spec, $opts);

  cleardb

    Deletes the drawing and all of its entities from the database.

      $drw->cleardb();

Internals
  parse_options

    Allows options to come in through the $spec or %opts.

      %options = parse_options($spec, \%opts);

  sort_addr

    Sorts through @addr_list and returns a hash of array references for each
    entity type.

      %these = sort_addr($layer, \@addr_list);
